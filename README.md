Weather Forecasting using Spatial feature based LSTM Model

**Overview**

Weather forecasting is the prediction of weather conditions for a given location and 
time through application of science, technology and principles of physics. The 
meteorological features such as atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind 
speed, precipitation of a given location collected over a time frame provides quantitative 
data describing the state of atmosphere at that particular point of time which is used for 
understanding the science of atmospheric processes to forecast future atmospheric state. 
Weather forecasting helps to plan the outcomes and influence of future weather 
conditions in our day-to-day activities. The ability to detect impending snow, rain, heat 
waves and floods help the public and government to plan and prevent its dreadful 
consequences. The information about future weather conditions helps to maintain 
commercial, economic, environmental and social interests. For example, weather 
forecasts in agriculture helps the farmers to plan their harvests and work load, utility 
companies to purchase sufficient supplies of power and natural gas, inventories and 
stores to match the demand and supply of resources, public to plan their outdoor 
activities and government to communicate the weather warnings to general public to 
protect their life and property within sufficient time.
