Weather Forecasting using Spatial feature based LSTM Model

**Overview**

 Developed a Short-Term Weather Forecasting Model using 
Spatial Feature Attention 

 Leveraged Python and Deep Learning libraries to pre-process 
meteorological data, train the LSTM Model and implement the 
attention mechanism.

 Achieved 89% accuracy in 48-hour weather forecasts through 
rigorous testing and validation of a Spatial Feature Based LSTM 
model.
